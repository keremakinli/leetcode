    "\n",
    "A password is considered strong if below conditions are all met:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It must contain at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It must NOT contain three repeating characters in a row (\"...aaa...\" is weak, but \"...aa...a...\" is strong, assuming other conditions are met).\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function strongPasswordChecker(s), that takes a string s as input, and return the MINIMUM change required to make s a strong password. If s is already strong, return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion, deletion or replace of any one character are all considered as one change."

    "## Solution\n",
    "#### Ideal solutions for seperate conditions:\n",
    "1. **If len(s) is not in [6, 20]:**<br>\n",
    "Characters must be added or deleted until condition is achieved.\n",
    "2. **If a type of char is missing e.g. digit:**<br>\n",
    "An abundant type character must be changed to missing type char, or <br>\n",
    "a missing type character must be added.\n",
    "3. **If there are repeating character substrings (RCS) e.g. 'aaa...a':**<br>\n",
    "We must change every third repeating character. So,\n",
    "```\n",
    "len('aaa...a') // 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "times change will be needed for each such substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### However, there are two kinds of changes that will help string meet two conditions at the same time. I will call these merge.\n",
    "**Merge Case 3:**<br>\n",
    "As long as there is a missing-type char and an RCS:\n",
    "We change third member of an RCS to a missing type char.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Merge Case 4:**<br>\n",
    "Given string is longer than 20 chars and we have RCSs.<br>So, we start deleting from repeating character substrings so that <br>we might need to change less characters in them or <br>we might get rid of them entirely. For example:<br>\n",
    "'1Ababababababababaaa' has 21 characters and 'aaa' in it. <br>If we delete a character from 'aaa' we won't need to do anything else anymore. <br>But this case can get more complicated with longer strings and RCSs with 4 characters.\n",
    "<br>So we must formulate this case as such.:<br>\n",
    "Let rcs[ ] be list of length of RCSs, we must first delete a char from an RCS <br>that is divisible by 3, that is to decrease rcs[i]%3==0 by 1. <br>So one char delete will result in one less char change. <br>Then we go for rcs[i]%3==1 and then rcs[i]%3==2. <br>Every time an rcs[i] will go from 3n to 3n-1, we get **1 more merge**.<br><br>\n"
