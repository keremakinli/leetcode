    "* It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It must contain at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit.\n",

    "* It must NOT contain three repeating characters in a row (\"...aaa...\" is weak, but \"...aa...a...\" is strong, assuming other conditions are met).\n",

    "#### The solution for len(s)<=20 is fairly easy.\n",
    "Add (in case of len<6) missing-type chars to third index of repeating character substrings or change third chars of repeating character substrings to missing-type chars,as long as both exist. Otherwise, just add chars to wherever necessary.\n",

    "'1AbabababababbAAAAAA' has 21 characters and 'AAAAAA' in it. <br><br>If we delete a character from 'AAAAAA' one char must be changed instead of two. <br>When length of repeating character substrings drop from 3n to 3n-1, we save one change operation. (Call it *1for1*)\n",
    "<br>From 3n+1 3n-1, we save one change operation for two deletes. (*1for2*)\n",
