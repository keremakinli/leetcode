    "\n",
    "A password is considered strong if below conditions are all met:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It must contain at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It must NOT contain three repeating characters in a row (\"...aaa...\" is weak, but \"...aa...a...\" is strong, assuming other conditions are met).\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function strongPasswordChecker(s), that takes a string s as input, and return the MINIMUM change required to make s a strong password. If s is already strong, return 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insertion, deletion or replace of any one character are all considered as one change."

    "## Solution\n",
    "#### Ideal solutions for seperate conditions:\n",
    "1. **If len(s) is not in range [6, 20]:**<br>\n",
    "Characters must be added or deleted until condition is achieved.\n",
    "2. **If a type of char is missing e.g. digit:**<br>\n",
    "An abundant type character must be changed to missing type char, or <br>\n",
    "a missing type character must be added.\n",
    "3. **If there are repeating character substrings (RCS) e.g. 'aaa...a':**<br>\n",
    "We must change every third repeating character. So,\n",
    "```\n",
    "len('aaa...a') // 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "times change will be needed for each such substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The solution for len(s)<=20 is fairly easy.\n",
    "Add missing-type chars to third index of repeating character substrings or change third chars of repeating character substrings to missing-type chars,as long as both exist. Otherwise, just add chars to wherever necessary.\n",
    "```\n",
    "max(chartoadd, change)\n",
    "```\n",
    "If len(s) is still <6, add more chars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Change third chars of repeating character substrings to missing-type chars, as long as both exist. Otherwise, just change any char. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### We need to delete characters smartly when len(s)>20.\n",
    "When there are repeating character substrings.<br>We start deleting from repeating character substrings so that <br>we might need to change less characters in them or <br>we might get rid of them entirely. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:<br>\n",
    "'1AbabababababbAAAAAA' has 21 characters and 'AAAAAA' in it. <br><br>If we delete a character from 'AAAAAA' one char must be changed instead of two. <br>When length of repeating character substrings drop from 3n to 3n-1, we save one change operation. (*1for1*)\n",
    "<br>From 3n+1 3n-1, we save one change operation for two deletes. (*1for2*)\n",
    "<br>From 3n+2 3n-1, we save one change operation for three deletes. (*1for3*)\n",
